# Apeach
A cute virtual friend built with **Electron**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — feed **Apeach**, give her flowers, take selfies, or let her sleep.
# Introduction
**Apeach** is my very first project made with **Electron**.  

It’s a simple and lighthearted desktop app where users can interact with a cute character named **Apeach**.  

You can:  
🍣 Feed Apeach  
🌷 Give her a flower  
📸 Take a selfie  
💤 Let her sleep  

This project doesn’t aim to do anything serious — it was created purely for fun and to practice building desktop apps using **Electron**.
